    "We will use the F1-score to evaluate our algorithm's performance. With our model, there are no drastic consequences if the model is wrong. It isn't as if we're working with medical data and may incorrectly identify if someone has cancer or not. So, we will simply use the F1-score, which provides the \"harmonic mean of the precision and recall\" (https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html). We don't particularly need to take into account false negatives or false positives when evaluating our data, so the standard F1-score will be sufficient.\n",

Our dataset has over 77,000 instances in it; this is an ample number of datapoints to have examples of a variety of different cases (in this case, positive or negative reviews). According to this website (https://machinelearningmastery.com/train-test-split-for-evaluating-machine-learning-algorithms/), the train_test_split method is commonly used for large datasets. If our model were to be implemented in the real world, we would want it to be efficient and be able to handle even larger datasets without having a large computation time. Thus, we determined an 80/20 split was the best course of action for our model."
